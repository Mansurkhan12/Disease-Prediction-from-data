**INTRODUCTION**
To create a disease prediction model based on medical data (e.g., symptoms, patient history), you can use machine learning classification algorithms. Below is an outline of how you can approach building such a model using Python and libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

We'll use a classification model to predict the likelihood of a disease based on input medical features (such as symptoms, patient history, test results, etc.).


**Explanation of the Code:**
1.Data Loading: We load the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from a public URL. It contains columns like Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, Age, and the target column Outcome, which indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

2.Data Preprocessing:

3.Handling missing values: We check for missing values. In this dataset, there are no missing values, but in practice, you'd handle them using methods like imputation.
Feature scaling: We use StandardScaler to normalize the feature values between 0 and 1. This helps some machine learning algorithms (like SVM, KNN) perform better.
Model Building:

4.We use Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning method. It works well for classification problems like disease prediction.
Model Training: We fit the model using the training dataset (X_train_scaled, y_train).

5.Prediction: After training, we use the model to predict outcomes on the test dataset (X_test_scaled).

6.Model Evaluation:

Accuracy: We calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set.
Classification Report: We print out precision, recall, and F1-score, which are important metrics for classification tasks, especially in imbalanced datasets.
Confusion Matrix: A visual tool that shows how many predictions were true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
